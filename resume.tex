\runsubsection{\large{team lead for RIT space exploration CubeSat avionics: Fall 2016 - Spring 2017}}
\descript{}\hfill \location{}\\
Working as Team Lead for the Avionics subsystem for the RIT Space Exploration student faculty
research group (SPEX). Responsible for keeping the team on track for planning, designing, and developing
software thatruns the main computer onboard the cube satellite. The Avionic
team's task was to research the hardware and software necessary to control
a Cube Satellite in orbit and complete a scientific mission. Gained knowledge
on the increased challenge of computation in a space environment along with
technologies such as Real Time Operating Systems.

\runsubsection{\large{High Altitude Balloon (HAB) Telemetry}}
\descript{}\hfill \location{}\\
Designed and developed telemetry software for SPEX HAB’s December 2016 launch. Responsibilities of
the software was to log atmospheric pressure, temperature, acceleration,rotation, and magnetic data to an
SD card. The project was written in C++, connecting to various sensors over serial bus protocols, SPI and
I\textsuperscript{2}C. Analysis of this recovered telemetry data proved critical to diagnosing a mid-flight mechanical failure.

\descript{}\hfill \location{}\\
SPEX is designing the payload, Hyperion, to serve as a rocket black box. Hyperion will also have protective
fabric landing airbags, similar in concept to those of older Mars rovers. Responsibilities for this project involve
part and sensor selection, and software design.
