% This template uses several fonts not included with Windows/Linux by
% default. If you get compilation errors saying a font is missing, find the line
% on which the font is used and either change it to a font included with your
% operating system or comment the line out to use the default font.

% TODO:
% 1. Integrate biber/bibtex for article citation under publications.
% 2. Figure out a smoother way for the document to flow onto the next page.
% 3. Add styling information for a "Projects/Hacks" section.
% 4. Add location/address information
% 5. Merge OpenFont and MacFonts as a single sty with options.

%
% CHANGELOG:
% v1.1:
% 1. Fixed several compilation bugs with \renewcommand
% 2. Got Open-source fonts (Windows/Linux support)
% 3. Added Last Updated
% 4. Move Title styling into .sty
% 5. Commented .sty file.
%

	\worksubheader{NASA DART - Double Asteroid Redeflection Test Mission}
	\begin{tightemize}
		\item Wrote flight software utilizing NASA Core Flight Executive.
		\item Adapted Ball Aerospace Cosmos to work with DART's command and data handling system.
		\item Leveraged code reuse by porting over software from Parker Solar Probe for DART.
		\item Worked on DART's software testbed developing in C++, also utilizing NASA cFE.
	%%Memeber of the Flight Software team.  Responsible for adapting Ball Aerospace Cosmos ground software (GSW) to DART's command and telemetry system. 
	%%Gained experience with NASA Core Flight Executive by supporting DART applications.  Leveraged code reuse by porting over software from a previous APL mission, Parker Solar Probe.
	%%In the process discovered a bug in Parker Solar Probe's code that was fixed and set to launch in August.
	\end{tightemize}

\worksubheader{Software in the Loop Environment for Testing Flight Software (SWIL)}\\
\begin{tightemize}
	\item Created adapters to relay SpaceWire traffic over UDP for testbed and flight software.
	\item Utilised Docker to develope an environment that increased frequency of testing by a factor of four.
	\item Enabled developers to rapidly implement features and test on dev machines
	\item JHU APL Explorer Award granted to DART team for bringing modern software practices to space.
	\item Attended Dockercon SF, work on SWIL was presented to the main audience.
	%\item Software in the Loop (SWIL) allows for parallelized testing within a CI/CD system. Allows for portable developer environment across OSes.
	%Used in development and testing of flight software. Utilizes containerization of flight software (FSW), testbed software (TBSW), and ground software (GSW).  Directly responsible for containerizing Ball Aerospace Cosmos GSW and TBSW. Developed UDP adapter of SpaceWire packets to allow for easy Docker Compose networking between FSW and TBSW.
	%Docker devops to run fsw development in a reproducible environment and the same setup in Bamboo CI/CD for parallelized automated testing.
