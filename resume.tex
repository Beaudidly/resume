% TODO:
% 1. Integrate biber/bibtex for article citation under publications.
% 2. Figure out a smoother way for the document to flow onto the next page.
% 3. Add styling information for a "Projects/Hacks" section.
% 4. Add location/address information
% 5. Merge OpenFont and MacFonts as a single sty with options.

%
% CHANGELOG:
% v1.1:
% 1. Fixed several compilation bugs with \renewcommand
% 2. Got Open-source fonts (Windows/Linux support)
% 3. Added Last Updated
% 4. Move Title styling into .sty
% 5. Commented .sty file.

\runsubsection{\large{team lead for RIT space exploration CubeSat avionics: Fall 2016 - Spring 2017}}
\descript{}\hfill \location{}\\
Worked as Team Lead for the Avionics subsystem for the RIT Space Exploration student faculty
research group (SPEX). Was responsible for keeping the team on track for planning, designing, and developing
software that runs the main computer onboard the cube satellite. The Avionic
team's task was to research the hardware and software necessary to control
a Cube Satellite in orbit and complete a scientific mission. Gained knowledge
on technologies such as Real Time operating systems along with the increased challenge of computation in a space environment.

\runsubsection{\large{High Altitude Balloon (HAB) Telemetry}}
\descript{}\hfill \location{}\\
Designed and developed telemetry software for SPEX HAB’s December 2016 launch. Functionalities of
the software were to log atmospheric pressure, temperature, acceleration, rotation, and magnetic data to an
SD card. The project was written in C++, connecting to various sensors over serial bus protocols, SPI and
I\textsuperscript{2}C. Analysis of the recovered telemetry data proved critical to diagnosing a mid-flight mechanical failure.

\runsubsection{\large{Space Dynamics Laboratory Payload Challenge}}
\descript{}\hfill \location{}\\
SPEX is designing the payload, Hyperion, to serve as a rocket black box. Hyperion will also have protective
fabric landing airbags, similar in concept to those of older Mars rovers. Personal focus for this project involves
computational hardware and sensor selection, as well as software design.

\runsubsection{\large{Project lead for microHab}}
\descript{}\hfill \location{}\\
Goals are to minimize the cost and integration time for High Altitude Balloon projects.  Roles involved are organizing
a multidisciplinary team and educating members on embedded software development.
